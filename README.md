# grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand

In this competition, Grupo Bimbo invites Kagglers to develop a model to accurately forecast inventory demand based on historical sales data. Doing so will make sure consumers of its over 100 bakery products arenâ€™t staring at empty shelves, while also reducing the amount spent on refunds to store owners with surplus product unfit for sale.
